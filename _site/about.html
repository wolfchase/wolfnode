About
</h1>
<h3 id="the-names-rodolfo">The Name’s Rodolfo</h3>
<p>But you can call me Rudy. Im a UCSC student majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Computer Engineering. It is not official if that’s what my degree’s fine print will be, but time will tell.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming and learning a lot of things. So many things that I will not bother to list them. But to sum it up, here’s a condensed list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Parsing</li>
<li>And algorithms of course.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>
<p>I usually just study. Therefore I’m very picky about any projects I currently work on. When I do decide to pick up a pet project and ‘maintain’ it, I make sure that I’ll learn something new and/or improve something of my skillset that is lacking.</p>
<p>Sadly this means I don’t contribute much to open source as I would like to. I also enjoy doubting myself as well and it doesn’t help when I want to feel confident about my code. But I consider this a big plus as a student; I am always striving to produce better code.</p>
<p>Since most of my projects deal with something I am inexperienced in, I have a bit of trouble resuming their development. Because of this, my motivation tends to ping pong among my projects. This also means however, that I am more open to applying new technologies to my projects (as I do not have a need to consider backwards compatiblity). This helps me to continue working on my projects even after I’ve called it quits.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-really-do">What I Really Do</h3>
<p>I sit in front of a monitor writing about things when I really should just be studying.</p>

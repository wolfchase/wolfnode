<p>As promised, the first post in my C tutorial series is here!</p>
<h1 id="c-and-why-you-should-learn-it">C (and Why You Should Learn It)</h1>
<p>The biggest reason I believe any programmer should have C under their belt, is mostly for the fact that they might not deal with assembly as much as programmers from the past did.</p>
<p>Sure this is a good thing, but it has developed a generation of programmers willing to give up efficient programming over compiler optimizations. This works for the most part, but it provides a false confidence that can be serious if not looked after. Programmers from the past had to be conscious about every line of code they created.</p>
<p>They had very limited resources (time, storage, accessibility) and usually had to make sure they got things right the first time. This skill is invaluable and quickly fading away.</p>
<h3 id="so-why-c">So Why C?</h3>
<p>It’s as close to assembly as you can get without learning assembly. It still does a lot of things for you, but it won’t manage intricacies. You must manage your own memory, be conscious of bound checking, looking for undefined behavior (that the compiler won’t tell you about) and various other pains.</p>
<p>However, it’s high-level enough to <em>not be</em> so much of a pain. You’ll learn alot about how higher-level languages handle their memory, and why they suffer from performance lost in comparison to C. It might even show you why sometimes C is an efficient enough answer. It is a language that is very simple, yet very effective at what it does.</p>
<p>Does it really keep up with modern times? Yes and no. Let’s consider golang for this. Golang is a language invented by Google a good while back. It borrows heavily from C’s nature of simplicity, but with some modern goodies to make your life simpler. Over the years, Go has become extremely popular not only with its original intended audience, but with a greater more general populace.</p>
<p>This is only one example of how C has influenced other languages. Sometimes other languages try to take a jack hammer to a problem, and C’s simplicity is just enough.</p>
<h3 id="but-enough-talk">But Enough Talk</h3>
<p>It’s about time we get our hands dirty!</p>
<h1 id="anatomy-of-a-c-program">Anatomy of a C Program</h1>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/wolfchase/2b0ddec1c2440ff8a437700da3c93ace.js"></script>
<p>A small down-to-the-ground barebones C program. Before we go off compiling this, let’s talk about the <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h3 id="cpp-directives">CPP Directives</h3>
<p>Before anything happens during compilation of a C program, the bare text of it is filtered through the C preprocessor (CPP). It looks for preprocessor directives; these are lines starting with a ‘#.’ I bet you’ve found the <em>include</em> directive already!</p>
<p>This does what it sounds like it does. Namely, it finds the file you specify; takes the text (or source code) from that file and inserts it into your program directly (just like copying and pasting). Don’t worry, it doesn’t take in the <em>whole</em> source code, just things needed for things to be referenced. We’ll talk about this referencing stuff in more detail in the next few posts.</p>
<p>So for now, <strong>#include</strong> just includes some stuff from the <strong>stdio.h</strong> file. This file is part of the C standard library (found somewhere on your computer). This file will be found by the compiler-it’ll know where it is I promise! Again, more details in future posts.</p>
<h3 id="hey-look-a-function">Hey Look! A Function?</h3>
<p>Not just a function, its the <em>main</em> function. As you could guess as well, it returns an <em>int</em>, an integer. What’s this void thing mean? Basically its just a fancy way to tell the compiler that this function doesn’t take in any functions.</p>
<p>What’s so special about a <em>main</em> function? There can only ever <em>be one</em> and no more. This is how the compiler knows where the program starts from.</p>
<h3 id="printf-youre-gonna-be-best-friends">printf (You’re gonna be best friends)</h3>
<p>Ah, the almighty printf function. It has friends too, but we won’t cover those until a good while. It does what it seems like, prints a given line. However, the f at the end definitely means something, <strong>format</strong>. It takes in a string that can be <em>formatted</em>. There’s also things called format specifiers to alter and modify output, but we’ll get to those next time around.</p>
<p>For now its worth keeping in mind that you have to put your own new line character, ‘\n,’ unless of course you want everything printed on one line!</p>
<h3 id="finally-we-return">Finally, we Return</h3>
<p>The <strong>return statement</strong> tells C that this function is now exiting and returning the stated constant <strong>0</strong>. Usually returning a number from the main function has big significance. It is conventional to return 0 upon a <em>successful</em> completion of a program. Anything else (most commonly 1) means the program encountered an error at some point in execution.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-compile">How to Compile</h3>
<p>You’ll need to have a compiler installed. If you’re on Linux or some equivalent, you might already have <strong>gcc</strong> installed. But for the time being, we’ll just stick to using ideone.com, an online compiler. As a matter of fact, the program is online ready for editing and compiling <a href="http://ideone.com/FTzSy9">here</a>. Play around with it if you want and get accustommed to ideone as well.</p>
<h1 id="well-thats-it-for-now">Well That’s it (For Now)</h1>
<p>I’ll be creating what I call <em>specials</em>. These will be posts that talk about things that might be too much to talk about in the tutorial series, but definitely worth checking out. The first one will be coming around sooner than later and will involve installing a C compiler on your system.</p>
<p>I also hope that this becomes a do-and-learn experience. I’ll do my best to increase the quality of these posts as much as I can! With that I let you all be and hope that you’ll continue to join me on one hell of an adventure.</p>

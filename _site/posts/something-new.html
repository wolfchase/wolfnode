<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything here, but I’ve got important news for friends and the like.</p>
<h2 id="leave-of-absence">Leave of Absence</h2>
<p>Due to housing concerns, I will probably go through with a LOA at UCSC. Though in despair because of this, I’m not entirely against the idea. The last two years have been heavy on the soul, never a night did I go without some burden on my mind. But last spring quarter, much has happened and a lot has gone through my head in that time passed.</p>
<p>Not only would taking a year off give me time to condense my thoughts and gather myself up, it would give me time to build myself up financially. This is a great chance to refocus myself.</p>
<p>I am of course still looking for housing, but seeing as how that is going, I am preparing for the worst.</p>
<h3 id="where-that-leaves-things">Where That Leaves Things</h3>
<p>I’m currently job hunting. I’ve found promising positions, given I don’t fail in interviews. It would be fun to work doing something I enjoy. But of course I cannot count on rainbows.</p>
<p>As far as studies and projects go. What a better opportunity than to work on them now I say. This also gives a chance to work on sharpening dull edges for my return to classes (I’m looking at you physics). I also enjoy freedom of personal study as I can account for the way I learn.</p>
<p>Projects-wise, I have many repositories that haven’t been updated in a while. Getting those projects running again would be a blast as I rarely find the time to do so during school years.</p>
<p><strong>All in all</strong>, I really just want to get things together, knowledge and financial. It would be nice to get a solid foundation on life before the next school year.</p>
<h3 id="and-the-website">And the Website</h3>
<p>I’ve been quite happy with what Hakyll has had to offer. But I feel I want a little more. I’m hoping to get a small web server going with Golang. It seems like a great project to further my experience with the language, that and the language just being a joy to use.</p>
<p>For the meantime, I’ve added a projects page highlighting some of my works on github and other miscellaneous things I do.</p>

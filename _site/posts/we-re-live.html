<p>I’ve finally got my personal blog site up! It took me a while to decide on which web framework to use, but in the end I’ve stuck with Haskell+Hakyll. So far the experience has been great. I’ve got just enough control over some dynamics without having too much dynamics (if that makes any sense).</p>
<h2 id="the-blog">The Blog</h2>
<p>I actually don’t know what I’ll blog about yet. I’m in the process of figuring out what tags to create for my posts. I feel once I have that out of the way I’ll be able to generate some content. For the meantime I’ll blog about the website’s progress.</p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>Speaking of tags, I’ll be working on those soon. Basically I’ll be able to categorize my posts so that viewers can find a post or search for content to read in a more convenient way.</p>
<h3 id="why-haskell-and-hakyll">Why Haskell and Hakyll</h3>
<p>I wanted to learn more about Haskell this upcoming summer, so in an attempt to do as much as I can with Haskell, I’ve decided to stick with it for my blog. Hakyll because static website generators are simple, secure and flexible enough for what I’ll be doing.</p>
<h3 id="disqus">Disqus</h3>
<p>I’ve set up Disqus for comments which I think is pretty neat. Hopefully anybody that reads around here (if ever) will say a thing or two. Hopefully; a man can dream.</p>
<h3 id="whats-in-store-for-the-near-future">What’s in Store for the Near Future</h3>
<p>The only other post I’ve got around here talks about a C tutorial series. I will be doing my best to go through with that. Other than that, I’ll probably be blogging about projects, UCSC and maybe things related to gaming. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Here’s a small code snippet test for myself.</p>

<h2 id="meanwhile-at-hq">Meanwhile at HQ</h2>
<p>I’ll be working on the aesthetics of the website and will be tidying things up. The current site design I’ve got going seems to be doing the trick so far. It is simple and unobtrusive and I consider that a plus. If you got any ideas for design I’ll be more than happy to hear of them.</p>

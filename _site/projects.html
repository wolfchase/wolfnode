<p>I’ve put some considerable work into these projects and therefore consider them to standout. I don’t actively work on ARDeTS anymore but Rain does, and continues to be my favorite pet project.</p>

<p>Rain is a discord bot with user plugins. It used to be an IRC bot for a friend’s channel, you can find that code base on the irc branch. I’ve slowly been building it up for a 0.1.0 release, but it still has some code with some features working, that being mostly core facilities.</p>

<p>Augmented Rapid Development Tracking System was a quarter-long project. Rated as a “A++” project by my professor, I’m quite proud with what I managed. The source may be rough and I regret that given that I’ve already done past web development projects. But that is mainly due to using new technologies such as web2py and vue.js. I was not quite prepared for the unique workflow. I would continue to update it, but Trello has filled in quite nicely for my needs. Though the simplicity of ARDeTS does motivate me to use it for academic work. Through this I might be able to find motivation to continue work.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-projects">Miscellaneous Projects</h2>
<p>Besides programming, I sometimes take part in other hobbies such as guitar and pixel art. I’ve listed some projects here that reflect that, I hope to add more.</p>

<p>I maintain some Starbound mods, mostly Avali themed. Might be worth checking out if you play the game.</p>

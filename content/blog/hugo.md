# Hugo!

I've just finished porting my website from Hakyll to Hugo and had quite some fun
in the process!

The original plan was to port to Django, so that I could learn it more 
thoroughly. However, the process was becoming rather slow and shortcoming. I
wanted to learn about a lot of things, front and back-end. This kept me from
just focusing on getting the site ported; most of the subjects I dwelved
into were too much for what my personal website demanded.

Also, hosting the website would be more problematic in the end,
since most of the requirements are satisfied via a static site.

### Static it is

So I've decided to keep to a static website. This time with the purpose of a
serious publish. That meant no Hakyll, as I was only using it to play around
with as much Haskell things as I could (and even then I wasn't learning much
about Haskell).

That left me with trying to find a new static site framework. Jekyll seems to be
a popular choice out there, but I don't know much about Ruby and wasn't really
motivated to learn about it either. Then I heard about Hugo.

At first I was quite hesitant to use it, from a very small first glance, it
looked limited. And I couldn't have been more wrong.

### Hugo is Cool

It took me a few hours to get to grips with (and quite haven't yet), but
after playing with Hugo and realizing its actual potential, I went ahead with
the port.

After I acquainted myself with the intricacies of Hugo (directory structure, 
front matter, and templates), getting most of my already developed source from
Hakyll to Hugo was pretty darn simple.

I haven't really gotten myself properly accustomed to Hugo just yet, but I will
definitely be doing just that. Hopefully soon, I can get some more content onto
here and update the more stale parts.

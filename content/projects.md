# Projects

## Notable Projects

I've put some considerable work into these projects and therefore consider them
to standout. I don't actively work on ARDeTS anymore but I do with Rain and continues
to be my favorite pet project.

### Rain (A Discord Bot)

Rain is a discord bot with user plugins. It used to be an IRC bot for a friend's
channel, you can find that code base on the IRC branch. I've slowly been building
it up for a 0.1.0 release, but it still has some code with some features working,
that being mostly core facilities.

### ARDeTS

Augmented Rapid Development Tracking System was a quarter-long project. Rated as
a "A++" project by my professor, I'm quite proud with what I managed. The source
may be rough and I regret it, given that I've already done past web development
projects. But that is mainly due to using new technologies such as web2py and
vue.js. I was not quite prepared for the unique workflow. I would continue to 
update it, but Trello has filled in quite nicely for my needs. Though the
simplicity of ARDeTS does motivate me to use it for academic work; through this
I might be able to find motivation to continue.

## Miscellaneous Projects

Besides programming, I sometimes take part in other hobbies such as guitar and
pixel art. I've listed some projects here that reflect that, I hope to add more.

### Starbound Mods

I maintain some Starbound mods, mostly Avali themed. Might be worth checking
out if you play the game.

I've finally managed to get myself some sort of personal webpage. After 
rummaging through quite a few toolchains for web development, I've decided
to stick with Haskell+Hakyll. I've got just enough control over some dynamics
without having too much dynamics (if that makes any sense).

All in all I'll be doing my best to update the site accordingly.

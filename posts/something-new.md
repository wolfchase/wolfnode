It's been a while since I've posted anything here, but I've got important news
for friends and the like.

## Leave of Absence

Due to housing concerns, I will probably go through with a LOA at UCSC. Though
in despair because of this, I'm not entirely against the idea. The last two
years have been heavy on the soul, never a night did I go without some burden
on my mind. But last spring quarter, much has happened and a lot has gone
through my head in that time passed.

Not only would taking a year off give me time to condense my thoughts and gather
myself up, it would give me time to build myself up financially. This is a great
chance to refocus myself. 

I am of course still looking for housing, but seeing as how that is going, I am
preparing for the worst.

### Where That Leaves Things

I'm currently job hunting. I've found promising positions, given I don't fail
in interviews. It would be fun to work doing something I enjoy. But of course I
cannot count on rainbows.

As far as studies and projects go. What a better opportunity than to work on them
now I say. This also gives a chance to work on sharpening dull edges for my
return to classes (I'm looking at you physics). I also enjoy freedom of personal
study as I can account for the way I learn.

Projects-wise, I have many repositories that haven't been updated in a while. 
Getting those projects running again would be a blast as I rarely find the time
to do so during school years.

**All in all**, I really just want to get things together, knowledge and financial.
It would be nice to get a solid foundation on life before the next school year.

### And the Website

I've been quite happy with what Hakyll has had to offer. But I feel I want a
little more. I'm hoping to get a small web server going with Golang. It seems
like a great project to further my experience with the language, that and the 
language just being a joy to use.

For the meantime, I've added a projects page highlighting some of my works on
github and other miscellaneous things I do.

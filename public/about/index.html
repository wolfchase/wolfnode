<h1>About</h1>

<h3 id="the-name-s-rodolfo">The Name&rsquo;s Rodolfo</h3>

<p>But you can call me Rudy. Im a UCSC student majoring in Computer Science with
a minor in Computer Engineering. It is not official if that&rsquo;s what my degree&rsquo;s
fine print will be, but time will tell.</p>

<p>I enjoy programming and learning a lot of things. So many things that I will not
bother to list them. But to sum it up, here&rsquo;s a condensed list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Parsing</li>
<li>And algorithms of course.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>

<p>I usually just study. Therefore I&rsquo;m very picky about any projects I currently
work on. When I do decide to pick up a pet project and &lsquo;maintain&rsquo; it, I make
sure that I&rsquo;ll learn something new and/or improve something of my skillset that
is lacking.</p>

<p>Sadly this means I don&rsquo;t contribute much to open source as I would like to. I
also enjoy doubting myself as well and it doesn&rsquo;t help when I want to feel
confident about my code. But I consider this a big plus as a student; I am
always striving to produce better code.</p>

<p>Since most of my projects deal with something I am inexperienced in, I have a
bit of trouble resuming their development. Because of this, my motivation tends
to ping pong among my projects. This also means however, that I am more open to
applying new technologies to my projects (as I do not have a need to consider
backwards compatiblity). This helps me to continue working on my projects even
after I&rsquo;ve called it quits.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-really-do">What I Really Do</h3>

<p>I sit in front of a monitor writing about things when I really should just be
studying.</p>
